## Description
     This is a web application displaying news articles from top leading innovation companies around the world. i.e Google, Tesla and Apple

## Behavior Driven Development
      1. When the app is loaded it first make a get request to the News Api.
      2. It then process the results and stores it in a list.
      3. The content is then rendered in the templates using placeholders and hence able to be displayed in the page.
      4. All this is made possible with in built classes and functions.
      5. The app is pushed to heroku where it will be available for display globally unlike before where it was visible locally.
